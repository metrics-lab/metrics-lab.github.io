## Lectures

Access to the 2020-2021 (pandemic recordings) of our machine learning and advanced machine learning (deep learning) courses are available from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eRcC2RF690JaoGl2rhtlxiAHw85qtspb?usp=sharing). These include videos, slides, jupyter notebooks and solutions.

I'm slowly uploading recordings or lectures and group tutorials to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG29i_rckT-JWNo6JHIyknA) 

## Soft Skills
[Writing workshop for students](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/k1644933_kcl_ac_uk/EZ3dSDcYRsdMonZa-wAhhlsBMhKXFGG8P-BRTt_3lpKcXA?e=zgAkvt)

[KCL probation/promotion training](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/k1644933_kcl_ac_uk/EaXB7YzaDBJCsl4vIeZwf78B9lQvTYC6kqFk0o3A24_cJQ?e=qs06Ym)

## Group Tutorials
We run tutorials on a variety of topics including machine learning, medical image processing and foundation neuroscience.

Below are links to slides and notebooks:

[Methods for diffusion MRI analysis in recent neonate studies](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/k1759240_kcl_ac_uk/EYrpr6GOaExMqlHzPhqcAV4BOwzeIe-aNHNYpvCmS9yn8Q?e=4FPZof)

[Gaussian Processes models in developmental neuroimaging](https://github.com/metrics-lab/talks_and_tutorials/blob/master/GaussianProcessModels_in_Developmentalneuroimaging.pdf)

[Using Animal Models in Perinatal Brain Research](https://github.com/metrics-lab/talks_and_tutorials/blob/master/Animal_Models_Of_Perinatal_Research%20%2B%20Preclinical_Imaging%20-%20Sept2019.pdf)

[Registration with Deep Learning]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/DLRegistration_2019_10_28.pdf)


## Software

The following open source code and software packages have been developed by our lab:

[dHCP surface to template alignment](https://github.com/ecr05/dHCP_template_alignment) - scripts to align neonatal cortical surfaces to the neonatal surface templates [available here](https://brain-development.org/brain-atlases/atlases-from-the-dhcp-project/)

[Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) structural pipeline](https://github.com/BioMedIA/dhcp-structural-pipeline) - pipelines for neonatal cortical surface extraction

[Geometric deep learning for cortical surfaces](https://github.com/Abdulah-Fawaz/Benchmarking) - code for benchmarking a range of geometric deep learning methods on neonatal cortical surface data 

[MSM](https://github.com/ecr05/MSM_HOCR) - a tool for multimodal alignment of cortical surface data. This is the image registration software used by the [Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipelines](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/hcp-mr-pipelines) and in the [HCP parcellation paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/doi%3A10.1038/nature18933)

[ST-fMRI](https://github.com/metrics-lab/ST-fMRI) - code for spatiotemporal deep learning on functional MRI data

[SVRTK](https://svrtk.github.io/) - Reconstruction tools for fetal MRI

[newMSM](https://metrics-lab.github.io/newMSM/) - the new, reworked version of Multimodal Surface Matching software

## Datasets

Below are freely available imaging atlases and datasets we have curated as part of our research: 

[Left-right symmetric cortical surface atlas for dHCP](https://brain-development.org/brain-atlases/atlases-from-the-dhcp-project/cortical-surface-template/) - we extend on the work of Bozek et al. (2018) to increase the age range to 28 - 44 weeks' PMA, and enforce left-right vertex correspondence

[Preprocessed data for benchmarking geometric deep learning on neonatal cortical surfaces](https://gin.g-node.org/lzjwilliams/geometric-deep-learning-benchmarking}{https://gin.g-node.org/lzjwilliams/geometric-deep-learning-benchmarking/) - sphericalised neonatal cortical surface data in native and template space, used to benchmark a range of geometric deep learning methods on surface segmentation and phenotype prediction
